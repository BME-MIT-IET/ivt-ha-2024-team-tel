# CI/CD Integration Overview (Travis-Docker) for Library Development

## Permission and Quota:
- Permission was required as we were not the owners of the repository on GitHub.
- The university's quota for Travis builds was exceeded.
- Consequently, we forked the repository to become owners of a copy, ensuring quota availability to test our configured Travis CI.

## Work Performed
We implemented CI/CD processes using Travis CI and Docker to enhance our library's development workflow. Travis CI was configured to automatically build and test the library on every commit. Docker was utilized to containerize our dependencies and provide a consistent environment for testing.

## Results
- Automated building and testing triggered by commits or pull requests.
- Increased efficiency through standardized Dockerized environments.
- Swift identification and resolution of errors and compatibility issues.
- Strengthened code quality and reliability through continuous integration and deployment.
- Successful tests result in the creation of a Docker image by Travis, pushed directly to Docker Hub for accessibility.

## Lessons Learned
- **Integration Benefits:** Streamlined development processes, ensuring rapid feedback on changes.
- **Consistent Environments:** Dockerized setups facilitated consistent testing and deployment environments.
- **Error Detection:** Early identification of errors and compatibility issues improved code reliability.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Enhanced understanding of CI/CD principles, fostering ongoing optimization.
