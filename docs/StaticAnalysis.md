# Static Analysis Documentation

## Introduction
Static analysis is an essential process in software development that involves analyzing source code without executing it. This documentation provides an overview of the static analysis process used in our project to ensure code quality and identify potential issues early in the development cycle.

## Tools Used
- Flake8

## Static Analysis Process
Our static analysis process includes the following steps:
1. Code linting with Flake8.
2. Checking for syntax errors.
3. Enforcing PEP 8 coding style guidelines.
4. Detecting potential bugs and common programming errors.

## Interpreting Reports
Reports generated by static analysis tools provide valuable insights into the code quality and potential issues. Common issues flagged by the tools include:
- Syntax errors
- Code style violations
- Potential bugs

## Best Practices
To minimize the number of issues flagged by static analysis tools, follow these best practices:
1. Follow PEP 8 coding style guidelines.
2. Write clear and concise code.

## Integration with CI/CD
Static analysis is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure that analysis reports are generated automatically (inside `static_analysis_reports` directory) during the build process. This helps in identifying and addressing issues early in the development cycle.
